Hold on! Hold on! You mothafuckas ain't shit to me\nThey say karma's a bitch, for you it's probably dentistry\nBecause the part of your mouth that's missing\nIs only a reflection of what's scarring you mentally\nSo the gap between your teeth\nExists merely as an object of imagery to distract you from the real gap between us—and that's bars and delivery!\n\nNovember 5th… it's ironic, you know, my father died on this day\nAnd I can still remember him telling me\n\"Son, say what you mean, and mean what you say.\"\nSee, I'm only 20, Diz\nSo in my past battles my emotions might have got carried away\nThat's why I flew here to Canada\nTo make sure that won't happen today\nSo when I grip the 9, rip your spine\nMake your body rewind—man, I don't mean that shit\nI'll probably never clap the shit out you\nBut trust I mean every word when I say I'll smack the shit out you\nThe difference between entertainment and real life\nLike, remember when I said I'll fuck you up in Vegas?\nWell, dependin' on how this battle goes, I still might\n‘Cause, see, I still might\nMove back, move back, what are you doing?\nGettin' in my face tryin' to go crazy\nTryin' to fuck me up when it's dead time\nWhen Drake's here in front of the battle\nBut you ain't gon' make none of his headlines\nWhat I was tryin' to say was\nThat the difference between entertainment and real life\nLike, remember when I said I'd fuck you up in Vegas?\nWell, dependin' on how this battle goes, I still might\n‘Cause me missin' a tooth only means\nI've been in a real fight and got real stripes\nSo until you get tapped with a sucker punch and missing yours from an uppercut, then you know what this feels like\nI took this battle for YouTube views, promotion and fanbase\nSo I made sure I'm well prepared\nKnowing my name would be buzzin' in Sweden\nChina, Switzerland, making them well aware\nSo once I get rid of this storm, and y'all see the weather clear\nJust think about the end of every other natural disaster\nYou gone see DNA everywhere\nRemember against A-Class when y'all was supposed to go 60 seconds, then on the day of the battle this guy switched it?\nThen remember against Swave you had timed rounds\nBut he said fuck it and you wound up rhymin' for 9 minutes?\nThen against me, this guy told Lush, \"I'm rhymin' till I'm finished.\"\nWhich only proves further you got a problem with time limits\nSee, you the snake that's tryin' to hide your rattle\nWhich only shows the Canadian Quarter\nAin't the only bitch that flips when it's time to battle\nAnd that's when I realized, hmm\nYou really got a problem with time\nLike when you say you're a terrorist and a hijacker, I'm not gettin' it\n‘Cause if you detonate a bomb\nWhat you gon' set the time to? Unlimited?\nYou really got a problem with time\nI discovered something, Diz, while I was watchin' your battles\nAnd nigga, you have never wore a watch in your battles!\nYou really have a problem with time\nIt's not opinion no more, it's a fact, nigga\nYou do twelve lunchbreaks \nChange times whenever you want with your hat to the back\nWhat the fuck you think you now? Black, nigga?\nY'all all know, we really got a problem with time, but fuck that!\nFor the last two years you've been givin' me the runaround\nI managed to stay relevant\nWith every battle reaching over 200 thou'\nYou done the same, but your music's trash\nSo the industry will never love your style\nWhich makes you a earthquake\n‘Cause you always gone be a disaster that remains underground\nSee, you just an entertainer, Diz! In other words: a fuckin' gimmick\nAnd it's for so long that the delivery can mask those fuckin' lyrics\nYour rhymes are put together sloppy and unorganized\nThat's why besides GrindTime we ain't fuckin' with it\nSo battlin' DNA will be the first time his verses have structure in it\nSo when you spit all aggressive with conviction\nI be thinkin' that you actually mad\nAnd then understand why you hate us New York niggas\n‘Cause he drive us around all the time in taxi cabs\nLike his rap battle D, he's supposed to be the big bad Dizaster\nAnd when I see DNA, I'ma shoot him and let the 5th clap ya\nI said \"Dizaster, let's fight!\" – he said \"Cool, I'ma bitch-slap ya!\"\nSoon as he hopped out the cab\nAll you hear on the radio is \"Dizaster, it's your dispatcher\nPlease go pick up Plex Rock and Lush One\nAnd stay away from DNA, you know you don't bust guns\nYou never touched drugs a day in your life or touched none\nAnd hurry up, your mom's calling, rents due, you must come!\"\nSo when you squint your fuckin' eyebrows\nAnd spit with alllll that aggression\nI almost think you might really bust your Glock\nBut then again we saw him against Arsonal\nAnd you ain't look too good with that fuckin' shot\nYou gon' try to rebuttal everything I say\nDon't act like you fuckin' not, but it's cool\n‘Cause a good rebuttal only means I had to say somethin' hot\nSo don't be confused when he rebuttal every lyric I say\nAnd think he's clever with frees\n‘Cause every time y'all cheer for that great rebuttal\nYou only givin' credit to me\n\nMan, DNA, you are so fucking hood!\nI'm gonna rebuttal everything you say?\nGoddamn it, I didn't even know I was that good\nShit, but fuck it, since he wants to talk about time\nThen we'll talk about time, when I roll up outside and hurt ya\nBut you're DNA, you never click-clack the burner\nYou never commit the murder\nSee, I do what I want with the time limits\nI'll just extend them further: this world's mine, I control time\nThat's why they call me the Prince of Persia\nBut you wanna rebuttal too\nI mean, you rebuttal'd your missing tooth\nBut that's not even a rebuttal topic\nI mean, you wanna rebuttal a missing tooth\nThen make a CD, put out some music, get some money off it\nWait 'til at least you have one deposit\nGo to your fucking dentist office\nWrite him a cheque with a fucking number on it\nAnd if it makes you feel any better about the situation\nYou can write the word \"rebuttal\" on it\nHomie, listen, it's been since day one I ain't liking you, dude\nWe can go outside right now and I'm fighting you too\nIt ain't about punchlines, DNA\nI'll just display how I'm a better writer than you\nSo stop talkin', pay homage, I'm spittin'\nI solve problems, I'm an awesome magician\nThis street magic, I'll make your beef vanish\nLike hot pockets, ‘cause all of you chicken\nI wanna squab with him, but if your squad is honestly trippin'\nThat car stoppin', that Glock poppin'\nYour top open like Top Ramen before you spark the ignition\nI start boxin', Bernard Hopkins\nYour heart stoppin', Chris Farley condition\nThere's no where to runin an arm bar, caught in submisison\nNow you lost in the mix, got a bunch of hostages with him\nHe tried hoppin' the fence, it's an impossible mission\nI'm camouflaged in the trenches\nReady to penetrate your army's defences\nWith these binocular lenses I have a prophet's vision\nIs that the hardest kid in your clique?

I guess time flies loud\n‘Cause if you ain't notice\nKing of the Dot is shittin' on Grind Time Now\nAnd your last three battles been in Canada\nSo this league basically made you, bitch!\nAnd you disrespected them in a battle? You ungrateful bitch!\nYou a faggot, I'm just tryna figure out what made you switch\nI guess Grind Time held you down and then raped you, bitch!\nI couldn't wait to get in your face to tell you I hate you, bitch!\nFlew all the way Canada\nTo put you in a wheelchair: Drake you, bitch!\nThey said DNA fell off, well, now I'm back — thank you, bitch!\nBut how's his pop rich and you say you struggle, dummy?\nYou take battles for free but gotta pay bills?\nI guess you don't care about no fuckin' money\nFor a couple of pennies he'll be ready to travel\nSo it makes sense when you ate that sandwich versus SMP\n‘Cause that's the only time you had bread in a battle\nThen you disrespected Jin and his whole race\nBut I bet you if you seen him you'd probably switch sides\nAnd dick ride and be pole-dancin'\nYou whine and cry about every battle, I bet you have a fit\nThat you don't get your way at your folks' mansion\nSo it makes sense why you hate Asians\n‘Cause you always throw tantrums\nAnd everybody knows that battle versus Locksmith\nThat one counted, ‘cause you showed you hated Asians more\n‘Cause when you choked you looked dumbfounded\n\"But if that's too low, then turn the volume on your speakers up\nYour rhymes is weak as fuck\nLike the last time Redman and Method Man tried teamin' up.\"\nAnd when he said that line versus Swave\nAt first I was like, \"Woooh, damn, that's hot!\"\nUntil Method Man co-signed you\nAnd you just disrespected a legend who gave you props\nAnd then if you talkin' like that, then of course he's frontin'\nThere ain't a course, I get him off for nothin'\nThis battle's six days after Halloween\nIt's ironic, ‘cause he already lost to Pumpkin\nAnd he said, \"In the MC book, when you fuck up you keep goin'.\"\nAnd in the eyebrow book, you keep shavin' if they keep growin'\n‘Cause I'ma keep it a hundred\nMy tooth's missin' and them eyebrows is real bushy\nSo King of the Dot, let's keep it a hundred\nOne of us is lyin' sayin' we get pussy\nWhen I run up on Dizaster in New York with a Knick's hoodie\nHe'll back down and get scared and get mushy\nOkay, I lied, I see one of us does get pussy\nBut why do you keep on talkin'\nWhen you act like you know you off the heat?\nMe, right now?

I'm off the beat\nI'll take your body off the concrete and throw it off the street\nYou got that dog chain on right now\nBut I'm the one that's off the leash\nSo why you keep rappin' like you be rappin' when it's dope\nYou a faggot, I'll clap it, then jack it like your coat\nYou told Swave you pop the 9, show him like Columbine\nYou think that you, Blood? Stop it, five!\nThey brought this yellow tape here\n‘Cause Organik knew it was a homicide\nSo don't act like your raps is hot or you'll blast the Glock\nTime's about to run out, you can have your knot\nYou have a problem with time\nSo you don't know how to stop on time when your raps is hot\nBut this Caliente will make you die before the aftershock\n\n\nYou dissed me about the Canada shit tryin' to snatch my props\nI think it's funny how you have to mention Caliente and Aftershock\nSo you can ride King of the Dot's cock\nThat's how you fuckin' get around, homie, I'll stomp you\nThe only reason you mentioned Drake in Degrassi\nBecause he reminds you of your mom too\nI'm basically nasty\nThere's a couple of questions my fans have been waiting to ask me\nDoes she really look like Drake from Degrassi?\nIs Cortez really on the sideline raking the grass leaves?\nYou fucking... you wanna get paid more guap now\nYou wanna get paid like an athlete\nBut you're on lockout, ‘cause you stay in a rap league\nThat only caters to Math's needs\nWhen you left your GrindTime family you disappointed them\nYou made them regret the fact they ever let you join with them\nNo one forced you off the boat, bitch, it was your choice to swim\nNow the only thing you'll ever ever have in common with Poison Pen is the fact that you'll never be boys again\nYou know what else rhymes with Poison Pen?\nUmm, I don't know, \"backstabbing disloyal friend\"?\nWhen you say \"bars over jokes,\" why you gon' pretend?\nYou don't truly believe bars are better than jokes\nYou're not keeping it a hundred and ten\n‘Cause you switch it up to comedy too\nI always hear laughter when your punches come to an end\nEspecially when you spit your gun bars\nWe all think you're the funniest then\nI mean come on, dawg, you really can't fuckin' rap with me\nI can go off the fuckin' top\nAnd this whole thing will become a tragedy\nYeah, motherfucker, you ain't wanna be the man right now\nYou fuckin' can't even see me, you can't even stand right now\nBut I take care of my shit and I can fuckin' kill you all\nYeah, you little fuckin' pussy, I don't feel you all\nBut since I'ma change up on this topic ‘cause I'ma kill it tonight\nI'ma touch up on a topic about why you lie\nAnd everybody's gonna feel it, a'ight?\nThis is a topic I wasn't gonna illustrate tonight\nI think most of the time your brains wouldn't be able to comply\nBut I figured y'all smarter generation are educated\nAnd figured I wouldn't be afraid to try\nSee, mainstream science is a bunch of manipulation in disguise\nThey blindfold you from the real truth\nTo distract you from a database they hide\nCharles Darwin is a faggot who thinks we came from evolution\nAnd later on we changed in size in a different phase in time\nWhat I'm tryin' to say to you is\nWhy would you believe in that and the Bible?\nThose are all fairy tales, goodbye\n‘Cause the truth of our genetics is written in the ancient scribe\nOur bloodline was given to us from aliens\nThat came from spaceships in the sky\nNow you're wondering why I'm saying this\nIt's ‘cause based on his name I can relate it to this guy\nIt's all reality based, all in this equation still applies\n‘Cause based on reality\nEverything ever said that was about DNA has been a lie\nI'm embarrassin' y'all lames\nI'm evisceratin' your jaw and I'm tearin' your small frame\nRippin' your fuckin' heart out and leavin' it there in the car lane\nYou st-st-stuttered when you tried to mention that dog chain\nYou stupid fuck! You have terrible blog game\nYeah, motherfucker, the \"true stories\" you're supposedly telling\nThey're lies and they're basically all lame\nDNA hears a story one way\nWhen it comes out of his mouth it apparently got changed\nSo you're not DNA, they gave you the wrong name\nYou should change your name into the American Arcane\nDNA! Yo, I'm DNA! Hold on! Hold on!\nNow I'ma roll up and I'ma come with the 5's and the 6 and the 7's\nNow when I go from 8, 9 and 10,t hat'll mean you get hit with 11\nThat's what you sound like: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\nIt's always the same thing: if I bodied Rone and Rone bodied Okwerdz, then what does that make me?\nShut the fuck up! Alright?\nYou're just an undercard to the main star actors\nWhat you gonna do now that Smack don't wanna pay off none of these maincard rappers?\nWhat you gonna do now, huh?\nDo like you did in Oun P and spit your little gay bars backwards?\nWhat you gonna do?\nRace me in a race track in a race car backwards?\nWhat you gonna do? Come with the metal after you summon the devil from listening to a Lil Wayne song backwards?\nWhat you gonna do? You wanna play that stupid little fuckin' game, then game on, faggot\nI'll leave your little brain all trapped\nInside one of your own little gay 8-bar patterns\nLike, go ahead, DNA, flip the word radar backwards!\nHold on! Hold on! I can do it, hold on!\nSo when I roll up with the AR and I spray off clappers\nThat'll be the result of this battle\nIf you spell the word radar backwards\nWait a minute, radar… that's still the same bar backwards!\nHold on, hold on! Now when I roll up with the \nAnd I spray off clappers\nThat'll be the result of this battle if you spell the word radar backwards… goddamn it, it's still \"radar\" backwards!\nTruth is, I'll break it down for y'all\nSince your boy Cortez, a.k.a. José, won't explain this stuff\nI was on the cell all day tryin' to set up this whole thang with Lush\nWhile you in the background with him\nDoing roleplay on the phone hangin' up\nYou think playin' with my money is funny, I'll blow this location up\nAnd I won't leave until I make sure your face gets crushed\nAdd more flame, I turn your torso and face to dust\nMore flame, the propane take your soul, raise it up\nI'll leave you fuckin' clothes  in your skull breakin' up\nAnd dislocatin' your shoulder bone from your rotator cuff\nYou smile like you don't use Colgate enough\nEvery couple of seconds when you're rappin'\nYour nose face gets touched\nLike your tryin' to point the way your cocaine is stuck\nOr your just another faggot actor\nWho thinks he's soulmates with Lux\nBut Lux is the man… Syke, you're both gay as fuck!\nI'll rip Hollow's hand off\nWhile it's still attached to his foam paper cup\nIt was, like, six in the morning\nI saw you and your little sister Jennifer Cortez sit on the corner\nHoldin' up a sign that said \"For food we're willing to sit on a boner\nPolish a ball sack and suck dick for a quarter.\"\nAnd underneath it said \"Please! All we had for dinner was yoghurt.\"\nYour little Smack gimmick image here literally won't work\nI bet Math used to punk you and make you finish his homework\nThis kid is like Conceited\nExcept he ended up hitting his growth spurt\nYour boy Murder Ave doesn't even exist, it's not even a known turf\nYou guys are both nomads\nThe only home this ho has is literally his own shirt\nLook at you rubbin' yourself tryin' to keep your composure\nYou ran away fuckin' Smack\nBecause the events they had were bigger and doper\nAlways bitchin' that Grind Time couldn't give you exposure\nSo you walked around for like six months\nWith a chip on your shoulder, before you decided to jump ship\nHoping to get you a little bit closer\nBut swiffed out on our interest\n‘Cause you were the diva that was tippin' it over\nAnd the sad part is all Smack had to do to bribe you\nWas promise to put some rims on your stroller\nThey offered Cortez a new fisherman boat\nSo he doesn't have to swim to the border\nAnd Hollow Da Don got a brand new Nintendo controller\nPeople always said your boy Cortez looked like Pitbull\nAnd even though he's the same identical poser\nNow I believe he's a pitbull\nSince I seen him switch up on his owners\nListen here, bitch, you have a listening disorder\nYour mission is officially over\nIf you think you gon' beat me I'd rather hire Jin as my chauffeur\nYeah, I'm a F15 engine versus a 1960 Corolla\nAnd you're missin' your motor\nI'll run up in your crib with them soldiers while you're sippin' a soda\nCatch you slippin', put you in submission and fold ya\nThen jump up and put my kicks on your sofa\nLike Tom Cruise did to Oprah\nYeah, what's going on, pussy?\nIt looks like that type of shit you cannot respond to\nYou said on the track 1.25 seconds on your song\nAbout your dad gone that you never clapped a revolver\nYeah, remember? One minute, 25 seconds\nYou looked up to the light and screamed out\n\"I've never touched a drug or busted a gun in my life!\"\nYou never clapped a revolver, I'll flat-line you\nSnipe at your heart like the final boss you battle in Contra\nSo act like Manic, so act like Manic, I'll pop ya\nGive me that deadly stare, I'll let it air\nLeaving shells everywhere like Italian pasta\nYou roll with a pack of imposters\nYou don't wanna scrap, I'll pull a MAC and I'll sock ya\nGet bitch slapped with the impact of A-Class crashin' his Honda\nI'll strike you faster than the Black African Mamba\nAnd send your body bag back to Rwanda\nBattling me is worse off than sharing a bath tub with Blanka\nOr getting a back rub massage from Mortal Kombat's Baraka\nYour breath smells like asshole and cacka\nYou need to grab some Binaca\nI'll backhand you and I will damage your chakra\nThe day you beat me is the day everyone in Canada considers Sno an actual Rasta\nWhat you know about weed?\nYour whole life you probably only seen two bags of ganja\nI'm a YouTube superstar, everyday I have new fans\nFrom Deutchland to Jakarta, from Buktan to Combala\nDominican Republic, and Yucads in Cabanas\nKuala lumpur and Sri Lanka down to Sudan and Uganda\nBut all you have is two fans: you're Kitana\nI saw you wearing earrings that one day, fake-ass shits\nPut on, probably put on, start wearing Prada\nInstead of fucking worrying about what you wear\nYou should try and display some honour\nYou scared to come to California\nAfraid I'll put them Grapes gangstas on ya\nBut every time you rap it's about how you bang your llamas\nAnd how you give my brain caps and you be making trauma\nAnd how your homies rolled around Vegas\nAnd shut the whole baby down and start creating drama\nBut that doesn't make you crazy\nThat makes you like QP's baby mama\nYou never shot a gun in your life, like you said\nYeah, and that's the reason why I'm having major problems\nWith the way you were brought up\nBut it ain't your fault, that's why I blame Madonna\nCome on, dawg, let's kick some facts and just be honest, huh?\nYou went to Smack, put up a stack and you peed on it\nAnd that is a fact, I ain't gotta actually speak on it\nFar as your Facebook statuses, the average is three comments\nYou leave today with a stash in your jeans pocket\nThen I'm smackin' that green off it\nYou went to Smack, got jacked for your bread and didn't  demolish you're average at best\nAnd to add to that threat this MC's polished\nFuck what this faggot just said, I rapidly clap with that lead\nAnd rip a patch up the back of your head like Rasheed Wallace\nYour mom's fucking retarded, I mean it!\nBut it's not the same, ‘cause she's also a genius\nShe gives a lot of brain: she's a quadriplegic\nI don't give a fuck about her eating problems\nShe can exercise some different feeding options\nShe can't use her hands, they shake\nSo if she wants to have some steak, she puts the knife between her toes and uses her retarded feet to chop them\nBut no matter how good she gets at holding the silverware\nShe always seems to drop them\nAnd then stands back looking at 'em\nLike, \"If only I had longer reach like Dhalsim.\"\nBut I don't want no beef, your mom's a G from Compton\nAny moment she might show up at King of the Dot\nAnd get them heaters poppin'\nSo I better flee before she acts like Stephen and brings the hawk in\nYou rapped about your dad in the beginning\nThat's some shit I wasn't gonna say\nBut I'm an evil motherfucker, so all that shit you were talking about, I think that shit is gay\nYeah, I will fly him out of his casket and I'll slump the faggot\nI'll fuck your mom in front of her and I'll soak the mattress\nThen I'll throw the broken prophylactic on his open casket\nI will forge a stack of boarding passes\nGet on board a Concorde and crash it\nInto an overpass during morning traffic\nWho said that? Come on! Admit it, homie! Speak up, brother!\nI'll go back there right now and I'll fuck your mother!\nCallin' fuckin' Organik like he fuckin' owes you somethin'\nMotherfucker doesn't owe you nothin'\n‘Cause you don't know nothin' about strugglin'\nLook at The Saurus and Illmac, yeah, look at The Saurus, cousin\nThey're battling for pride\nIf they lose today they're going home with nothin'\nBut you're too much of a pussy, a battle you won't go judgin'\nYou'd rather be a fuckin' homo and just vote on public\nYo, who the fuck is talking, bro? Yo, who's talking?\nA'ight, I see you're offended because his mom is being brought up\nOkay, that shit is some harsh stuff\nBut this is battling, what do you expect?\nThis is the type of shit that pops up\nWhat? What?! Y'all fuckin' mad his mom is brought up?\nI don't give a fuck if they have special needs\nThey got all types of foundations to get their guap up\nI don't know about y'all, but\nI've already donated enough money from my heart into that large cup sitting at the counter in every single Starbucks\nFuck you! Don't ever fuck up my battle!\nI'll pick up your bitch and I'll hump her like my camel\n\n\nDid anybody see who he was talking to?\nNo! Me neither, so why'd y'all think that was hot, y'all?\n‘Cause you looked up there for five seconds\nAnd talked to something unknown, like a blocked call\nSo, Diz, why do you think you getting hot\nAnd, like, you gon' grip a round?\nMe, DNA, I'm in Canada my first time, I'll rip the town\nShow you how I'm the illest\nAnd I'm the realest with the sickest sound\nHe kept mentioning Hollow, but it's like his battle with Hitman\n‘Cause when I pull it out I won't miss the pound\nSee, if y'all really think about that\nNow I'm gonna try to stay calm and keep my cool, b\nBut I've been watching King of the Dot battles\nAnd I saw a dude that had potential we would soon see\nAnd I don't like bringing up people that died usually\nBut truthfully, this faggot should've died instead of Bruce B\nYou're not a shot buster, at Blockbuster you wouldn't move E\nYou dick ride and switch sides, you a groupie\nI don't know that much about Canadian change\nBut I tell y'all truthfully\nI know for a two dollar coin he'll be on his two knees\nSo, Diz, why would you even start though?\nYou act like you gangsta and you tough\nLike you got the heart though\nYou a bitch, I'll have more whips at your house than a car show\nSmoke him down, just like a Marlboro, never at heart though\nSince he think he street in Canada\nIf it's war, then I'll mark him and leave his face with a scar, bro\nDizaster, I have a question: why do you rap like this?\nYou spit no punchlines, but do all of this\nWhy do you act like this?\nSee, you wanna act crazy, like, you could stop with this\nThis isn't a battle of battling\nThis is a battle of Dizaster battling Alcoholic Anonymous\nHe's standing here in front of Organik\nThinking that he's the rapping answer\nAnd I bet you wish you can get a disease\nSo you can battle cancer\nYou think you're so nice so you can rap for weeks\nDizaster has insomnia on purpose, so he can battle sleep\nI bet your grandma's 97\nAnd listens to \"Arab Money\" to get her party off\nYou make bombs so much you wake up to car alarms\nIf your man's name was Puff Daddy\nThen you'd suck off Sean and John\nI show up to your mom's house\nWith pepperoni on a Papa John's\nAnd take it back when she opens it and tell her it's ramadan\nSo, nigga, why you acting tight?\nI heard they sling out here in Canada\nI seen today you stayed calm, you ain't vexed\nBut how the hell you ever expect to be the King of the Dot?\nNigga, you ain't Rex\nSee, y'all don't get how I can switch that, nigga, when he's next\nI broke that down, King of the Dot, Dot Mobb, T-Rex\nOh, see, y'all might not get that with that bar\nMatter of fact, uhhh—that was okay when I make rhymes\nBut I bet you get the bar\nWhen I let off this gun and let that K shine\nRan into his crib when I set you off with that burner shoot\nAnd after that you get murdered\nAnd murdered even worse just like Murder Mook\nSo why you keep talkin' like you the best, cuz\nNow I'ma get on some other shit\nDisconnect your body, they won't find where your head was\nNow they over there with the morgue\nThe doctors don't know where your leg was\nYour family come and try to see you in the morgue\nAnd they don't know where his head was\nNow, you looking, he's just a John Doe\nSo when his DJ goes to make a \"best of…\", they gon' have to put a question mark in front of his name, like ?uestlove\nNow we here in this battle, Diz, so say what you say now\nIf you act up, then come through, I'll let off that tre pound\nWhy talk about a gun\nWhen I got dawgs on each side, like Greyhound?\nBeat you up to the part 'til you can't even stay now\nYou won't have a future, like that nigga from 8 Mile\nRun around with the sixty\nAnd leave your body on the playground\nThey'll be nothing but your soul left, just like James Brown\nPick him up, snuff him\nAnd watch me spin money online, like PayPal\nAnd he still gonna try to rhyme\n‘Cause he gon' act like he's better\nDizaster, you think you so tough with these bars\nBut I really don't think you better\nYou can never come through and act like you fresher\nI found out that his sign's a crab\nWhich means that he's a cancer\nAnd that explains why you always crack under pressure\nSo, Diz, why you gon' act like you goin' when it's hot?\nHow can you respect the nigga\nThat disrespect the dude for making a song for his pops?\nBut he gon' act crazy like he fear harder\nBut since you mentioned my dad, you reminded me of him\n‘Cause after this, y'all won't see your career goin' farther\nSo why you wanna act like you step beat fast?\nNigga, I pop and leave, like dead beat dads\nAnd then he wants to talk crazy\nLike you come through and smash your men\nIf I could do this then, Dizaster, we'd fight\nAnd I'd beat up this fag again\nI heard Hollohan's in jail, that's all cool\nI wish he could be here to rap again\nBut if y'all all know the Bible the only way God can come back is when the disaster end\nSo how you think you dumb funny?\nHow you just say I was scared to battle for three stacks\nBut then you came at Drake? That's why you got young money\nAnd you never have cash when you grippin' it hard\nSo, nigga, I'll blow your brains off, then blow your other brains off, then blow your other brains off\nAnd keep changing wigs, like Nicki Minaj\nIt doesn't make sense, Diz?\nSo why you think that you straight hotter?\nIf I don't know what I'm saying when I don't make sense\nWell, nigga, you don't make dollars\nYou never had money in the rows when know I'm getting silly\nIf this don't make sense\nThen how come we only battled for $750?\nNow come through when you act like you crazy\nAnd you fuck with that; tell the truth, Diz\nWe could've battled on Smack for double that\nBut you tried to do it here at King of the Dot\nAnd I said, \"That's cool, I plan it.\"\n‘Cause you never get nothin', you never act up and blam it\nYou're a waste of a nut\nYou shouldn't even belong on this planet\nAnd, truthfully, you should've got fucked up\nBy the cops instead of Organik\nSo why you keep acting like you so tough\nLike you can spray shells?\nAw, you're yawning while I'm rappin'\nThat's all cool 'til I spray well\nYou think that I can't do what you do\nI can do it better when I Raylell \nJust think of this battle with the L.A. initials backwards\n‘Cause that's what he's leaving with: a L\nSee, Diz, you wanna keep rappin' crazy\nWhen you try to act like you flow like best\nBut you can't come through, nigga, I put a hole like chest\nNow I ain't even come through to rap with it\nI'ma show him how Smack and quick\nGon' dap this bitch after that I clap the clip\nHe keep movin' his head back until I smack it quick\nYou a faggot that I never come through and dap you, bitch!\nI'll run up in your crib, real too, and smack it quick\nAnd shoot him while he's writing with his pen\nNow that's how you air a bic (Arabic)\nAnd that was a half punchline, that ain't even the half of it\nNow I'ma switch up and talk to this nigga in Arabic\nHedat, your family told me you're a maniak\nThere's a thousand words in the Arab dictionary\nBut my favorite one is Eddifat\nElla Stasi, ‘cause these dudes wanna keep talking with the clip\nBut after that I'm like \"Pulla Misha Marka!\"\n‘Cause that means you're a bitch\nAnd after that I'ma say \"It's getting hot in here.\"\nAnd Ik Fala Watchi! Y'all know what that means in Arabic\nGet him the fuck outta here!\nSo why this dude acting up like he playing with me?\nOh, you thought we was in Canada\nSo they wouldn't say it with me?\nNigga, please! Why you play inside?\nThat slogan is like Boost Mobile, that shit's nationwide\nSo why you acting crazy with the best shell\nThese clips will make you sprint\nAnd find your body in the next tell \nWhy you keep talking like you bet for sure?\nOh, you know about the hotels we in?\nYou on the 6th and I'm on the 7th floor\nThat's cool, nigga, so stay up\nAfter I blast with the shell, I hate to leave him on the elevator\n‘Cause he'll be going on his way up\nSo you keep rhyming, Diz\nKeep spitting all these bars when I clap ya\nActing all hard, but see, you not a real dude, you just a actor\nIt doesn't matter what you say\n‘Cause you're gay and you just a actor\nYou can't do what you do ‘cause, nigga please, I'm the pastor\nBreak you down  crumble you're body like Ritz crackers\n‘Cause I got a question y'all: what's a disaster to a rapture?\nHe can't move it on that blink screen\nYou so stupid you can't do what the blinks, D\nI kill him in fucking 7HD, a HD, come through\nTurn his body soul, rip it apart and have it lookin' like gangrene\nFuck up your soul, have your body lookin' like brinkscreen \nI'ma teach your old teacher stupid I make greenery\nSo after I do that when I spark fiends\nShoot him in his pockets with money\nAnd you gon' see that wall green\nAnd after I do that on a nice day, hit him with that nice tre\nThen doctors and paramedics\nGon' be having to find the right aid\n‘Cause I'll run up on that whip, when I'm steerin' now\nI see that he's fearin' now, I clear the town\nBishop Brigante ratchets\nI shoot it in your face and tear that mirror down\nYou clear the town when I'm offin' the dome\n‘Cause right now, please nigga, frees, top of the dome\nI come through—fuck that!\nLike you said you always talk about poppin' the shone \nBut after I shoot I'ma have to off his top, like Charron\nAnd he keep thinking he coming praisin' when you on that\nYou acting like you can freestyle\nAnd rhyme, nigga, like you move on that\nYou say that you like rhyming nerdy\nBut I don't get it when you cool on raps\n‘Cause every battle you have with a street rapper\nYou talk about guns like you on Smack\nSo, Diz, how does that make sense, when it's so lovely?\nYou said that you didn't shit on King of the Dot\nAnd now it's so lovely\nNow you gon' try here get in my face and try to punk me\nSo let's break it down\nOn exactly what he said about this country\nNigga, who are you airin'?\nYou just stand six feet tall and didn't do shit\nNigga, who are you scarin'?\nLike, what's wrong with this dude?\nI had to tell him five times and maybe one time?\nLike, we know, you know, we both freestylers\nSo why would you do that? So I can make a punchline?\nLike, I don't get it when I blam it\nNow back to what I was talking 'bout with Organik\nLike I said, right? This dude gon' act like he's on his grown shit\nWhen I mentioned King of the Dot, you should've said something, but since you didn't I'ma rebuttal your own shit\nLike when I said you disrespected King of the Dot\nAnd that was lovely, then you should've replied\nWell, then Organik disrespected our country\nAnd that's when I would've told you\nI'm disrepectful for spittin' in your face\nBut I got more respect for Organik\n‘Cause at least he did it in our face\nAnd you pussy, you never hold the 9 and spray\nLike when you said \"Canadians are faggots!\"\n\"Canadians are faggots!\"—you did that shit miles away\nSo now that we here in Canada\nAnd you said they have no military, they have no healthcare\nAnd Canadians are faggots—say it again, Diz!\n(Diz: DNA's a faggot!)\nNo, say it again, Diz, about Canada!\n(Diz: Canadians are faggots! Boo)\nDiz, what's going on here?
