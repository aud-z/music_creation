Far from home ###

She said she broke it down
And then collected them like model ships
We danced through the rain
Her jaw was set and her eyes were blue


And now she's leaving on an eastbound train
To find her youth in the west
But neither one of us will know where
She sleeps or who she kisses there
It's hard to leave an old love alone
Just hard to leave her

And now she's over the earth
On a westbound train
In a place where the years have no number
She sits alone, she sits alone
She sits alone, she sits alone


From birth until forever
No words are ever lost
The future frozen in the present
The pens that I hold
Take my future from me
But you can touch my heart
And support it alone

And now she's leaving on an eastbound train
To find her youth in the west
But neither one of us will know where
She sleeps or who she kisses there
It's hard to leave an old love alone
Just hard to leave her
And now she's over the waves
And sleeping in them too
She drives this shell
And goes on a westbound train


To be young and broke, in love but still alone
Must sound like heaven to you, babe

And now she's leaving on an eastbound train
To find her youth in the west
But neither one of us will know where
She sleeps or who she kisses there
It's hard to leave an old love alone
Just hard to leave her
And now she's over the waves
And sleeping in them too
She drives this shell
And goes on a westbound train


But she's young and broken too, whoa
She's young and broken too
Must sound like heaven to you
And she's young and broken too, whoa
She's young and broken too, whoa
Must sound like heaven to you, babe
