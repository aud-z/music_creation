Next time we ### are all alone
Let's put on our party clothes
I will get everyone classical
Forget about the world for one night


Ella, wasn't that when you made out with your boyfriend
In the cab rollin' down the street
Smellin' like gin
Whoa you can wear my sweatshirt
Whoa, ohhh you look hot baby
Pullin' up in that fancy car
Hello cousin
Ooh, aren't you the one, and aren't you hot?


Oh, s***, let's move to Barcelona
Stay at my aunt's apartment
We can take the Metro
Drink some bad coffee
Be wild, be free


Oh, s***, let's move to Barcelona
Stay at my aunt's apartment
We can take the Metro
Drink some bad coffee
Be wild, be free

I am British and don't speak Spanish
But we can still be young and reckless in a foreign land
We will chase the waves, kick them up
An ABBA homage for one
And then I'll drape your jacket over a chair
'Cause I'm sweating so much, you can take a dip
While you kiss me for the hour I spent at Rosetta
Yeah, I'm sick of kissin' on the flippin' plane
And I want you to feel it from behind

Heat's coming up
Out cold
