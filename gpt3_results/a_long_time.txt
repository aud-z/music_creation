But you can't say you miss me baby 'cause I'm too far away
And I know my gone is running 'round the world
But in some strange land, your gone is still here
You can't say you miss me baby
I'm too far away

I've been a long time gone
But I won't let you know
She's the best part of me
And I won't be far from you now
I'll be back because I love you

You don't have to dream anymore, no more, yeah
I keep going, day after day, don't forget that
She's the best part of you baby, yeah
I won't be far from you now
I'll be back because I love you

I've been a long, long time gone
But I won't let you know
She's the best part of me
And I won't be far from you now
I'll be back because I love you
'Cause I love you

But this is the song of a woman who is not so beautiful
But is she the best that the man has ever had? She's like wallpaper
Who was his wife, but the history he cut herself off
So he's a fish, who's not coming out of hiding
She's an alien
Who is spying on his side

You can't say you miss me baby 'cause I'm too far away
And I know my gone is running 'round the world
But in some strange land, your gone is still here
You can't say you miss me baby
I'm too far away
