Fake love is music
You say you want my body but you couldn't handle it girl
If I played with your emotions would you still want me tomorrow?
Lips like struablesses, hands like guitars
Diamonds on the divers but only for your eyes girl
It ain't no damn SPOOKTICALITY
You're in love, no it ain't no damn bore

Gotta get you out my head, never gonna get old
Gotta get you out my head, never gonna get old
Gotta get you out my head, never gonna get old
Gotta get you out my head, never gonna get old

I don't even pretend to understand the grown-up side of love
Sitting in the front row losing my mind over the light
You may think we're just a couple of teenagers playing school
But I know everyday you are changing, just like the weather
Repeat it again you're a fake love
Never gonna get old, fake love
Fake love is music
I don't even pretend to understand the grown-up side of love
You're in the front row dying to know what the light looks like
Just sit down dear and watch the band rehearsing for their show
We're all changed like the weather, repeat it again
You're a fake love, never gonna get old, fake love
Never gonna get old, fake love, never gonna get old

I don't even pretend to understand the grown-up side of love
We're all changed like the weather, repeat it again
You're a fake love, never gonna get old, fake love
Never gonna get old, fake love, never gonna get old
I don't even pretend to understand the grown-up side of love
We're all changed like the weather, repeat it again
You're a fake love, never gonna get old, fake love
Never gonna get old, fake love, never gonna get old
I don't even pretend to understand the grown-up side of love
We're all changed like the weather, repeat it again
You're a fake love, never gonna get old, fake
