Monsters come out ###

I have to travel to the darkest places
Anywhere where monsters hide in the trees
I have to seek them out in the dark
Because I'm scared They could be gone
Don't worry I'll catch every one that you send my way
I can't let you take me alive


You think you die young and leave a little something behind
Well, we all die and you need to know
That I've been here, and I'm not the only one
You come here, but you leave behind your life and I


Your last breath, my last breath
Funeral brought you, one last time
We all fall, no deal, children leave and lovers hide
Right back in the dark


Oh, this was all a show
Hope you enjoyed it, you died a little everyday
Lyrics around your neck
This was all a show
Hope you enjoyed it, you died a little everyday
Lyrics around your neck
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Live show, locked out
We were rehearsing
Dark souls, penumbra shadow
Feeling no air
Small screens, keep you sterile
Lions tight in cages
House of terror
People worship
Big screens, electric pulse
Houses are full, soundproof surfaces
Nobody watching our names, we're meant to be
Underneath the silver screen, we're trapped in reverse
Know no better

I have to go where the bad things go
Anywhere I have to go that the good things don't go
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Don't mess with us


I have to ask questions
Anywhere where I die someday
In between the question marks lies the end


You think you die young and leave a little something behind
Well, we all die and you need
